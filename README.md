# webstore is a demotration of what I am capable to do with spring framework and other projects in Spring ecosystem.
An application (E-commerce) built with Java (Spring,Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Security, JavaMailSender, 
JPA &amp; Hibernate, Thymealeaf, MySql, Html 5/ CSS3 ,Bootstrap).
I've deployed it on heroku and in development mode i use MySql and in production I am using Postgresql.
